With the help of these expressions, you can effectively block all unnecessary requests.
In addition to this, it is highly recommended to activate the "Bot Fight Mode" feature, which can be found in the Security tab.
This feature is designed to detect and block automated bot-generated traffic, including malicious requests like DDoS attacks.
By enabling this feature, you can significantly enhance the security of your system and minimize the risk of security breaches.
However, it is worth noting that this feature may also block legitimate traffic, so it is crucial to regularly monitor your system and adjust the settings as needed to ensure optimal functionality.

## ⚠ Warning
It is important to note that these expressions should not be used if you are using WordPress or any similar CMS. They are highly recommended for Node.js applications based on frameworks like Express.
